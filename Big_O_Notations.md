Here are five Big O run times that youâ€™ll encounter a lot, sorted from
fastest to slowest:
|    O notatation | Explantion |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| O(log n)| Binary search|
|O n |Simple search known as linear time|
|O (n * log n) | Quicksort (fast sorting)|
|O n<><sup>2</sup>|selection sort (slow sorting)|
|O (n !) |traveling salesperson (the slowest)|
