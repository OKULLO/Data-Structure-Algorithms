Big O notation
Big O notation is special notation that tells you how fast an algorithm is

O<sub>n</sub> 
where
```
O is big Notation
n is number of operations

```

Here are five Big O run times that youâ€™ll encounter a lot, sorted from
fastest to slowest:
|    O notatation | Explantion |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| O<sub>(log n)</sub>| Binary search|
|O<sub> n <sub>|Simple search known as linear time|
|O<sub> (n * log n) <sub>| Quicksort (fast sorting)|
|O<sub> n<sub><sup>2</sup>|selection sort (slow sorting)|
|O<sub> (n !) |traveling salesperson (the slowest)|
